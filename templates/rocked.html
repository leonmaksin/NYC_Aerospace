<meta name="description" content="NYC Aerospace is a non-profit organization based in New York that designs and builds high power rockets, and is in the process of sending a cubeSAT to space. Our mission is to launch a spectrometer into inner-earth orbit utilizing CubeSAT technology. This will make us one of the only schools in the United States to launch a fully-capable satellite and collect data from it while it is in space.">

    <div class="mission-content-holder start-row-flex">
        <p class="mission-content mission-p">RockED began as a realization that many students in New York City do not have proper opportunities to pursue careers in the aerospace industry. Without proper support, such interests can become nearly impossible to realize. Surrounded by tall buildings and indoor facilities, students are rarely, if ever, exposed to the wonders of the aerospace industry. RockED was founded to provide support to students interested in aerospace in New York. We hope to help you succeed.</p>

    <div class="mission-content-holder start-row-flex">
        <p class="mission-content mission-p">Our goal at RockED is to provide outreach and learning opportunities to students in New York interested in the aerospace idustry. Aerospace is a growing industry, and aerospace engineering will be one of the future's most demanded skills. Since most students in New York City lack the opportunities to engage in aerospace education, we are here to give them the support they are lacking.</p>

    <div class="mission-content-holder start-row-flex">
        <p class="mission-content mission-p">We will be presenting and hosting workshops at high schools throughout New York. Topics covered include a brief introduction to NYC Aerospace and our goals, what aerospace engineering is, and most importantly, what you can do to pursue an interest through NYC Aerospace. During workshops we will introduce students to basics of engineering, physics, and rocketry through hands on activities and design competitions. You can participate and learn through other departments of NYC Aerospace, or, with our support, start you own branch for NYC Aerospace for your school or community!</p>
